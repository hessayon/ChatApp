# ChatApp
Training project from iOS development Udemy course

There are 4 views - welcome view, registration view, login view and chat view.
Firebase is used to store logins, passwords and messages.
UITableView is used to display messages. My own tableView cell design was created.
Also I used third party libraries for text animation (CLTypingLabel) and for working with UITextField and keyboard (IQKeyboardManager).
